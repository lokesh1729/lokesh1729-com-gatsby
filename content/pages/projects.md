I have been working on multiple projects apart from my full-time job.

## Domain Hunter

[DomainHunter](https://domainhunterr.com) is my first product that is deployed to production. It generates domains that are available for registration from the given search terms using OpenAI.

## Job Board

It is an aggregator of the jobs scraped from company's career pages. This is built using Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. The idea is to build a generic job board software and then customize it to host multiple job boards using it.

## Mutual Funds NAV Alert

Unlike stocks you cannot set alerts on the NAV of a mutual fund. No mutual fund broker platform gives this feature. This will be very helpful when you want to sell but the price is not as you desired. I have not started this project yet. Once started, will update here.
