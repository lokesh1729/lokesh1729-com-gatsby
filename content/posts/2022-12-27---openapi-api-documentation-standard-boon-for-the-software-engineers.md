## Introduction

Your product manager brought a new product requirement. Frontend engineers and you (backend engineer) finalized a solution. They asked you for an API contract. You created a google doc (or confluence) and gave it to them. The contract changed later and you update the code as well as the document. Wouldn't it be so nice if the documentation also lives in your code repository and automatically updates along with your code changes? That's where OpenAPI comes in.

### What is OpenAPI?

OpenAPI is a standard for defining documentation of backend APIs. It is in the form of a file called a specification document. It can be in YAML or JSON format. OpenAPI sets standard syntax to define an API contract.
