Being a software developer, you may desire to work on large scale systems that serves thousands to millions of users. Not everyone gets this chance, only few lucky chaps gets it. The other people try to get into such companies. **The hard truth is it's not the company that matters most, it's the team that you're part of is very important**. To get into such teams, you need to raise their bar. So, you need to pull up your socks, come out of your comfort zone and start preparing for interviews. In this post, I will share the learnings from my past experiences. 

Note: assume that the interviews are given to top product based companies. Their process would be 2 DS algo rounds + 1 or 2 system design + 1 manager/vp/director of engineering round + 1 behavioral + 1 HR/final discussion. In DS & algo rounds, the questions are mostly from leetcode.

1. **Bad interviewers**

   Sometimes you may encounter bad interviewers, they may make you feel nervous ending up you bombing the interview. I faced the similar situation in a interview which ended in rejected status. You should take the responsibility to make the interview like an interactive session not like an interrogation. Few interviewers may not introduce themselves, they directly ask about you and jump into coding problems which may feel you nervous. You should stop and ask them about their introduction, which team they belong to etc...
2. **Do not solve the leetcode problems partially during the preparation**

   When you are preparing do not solve any problem partially. Solve them completely until you understand them. When you did not fully understand, you'll get confused when the same problem is asked in the real interview. I was solving this [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) few days back before it appeared in the real interview. I had solved it but i still had confusions about the approach. I did not clear them up before, so i screwed it in the interview. I was able to explain the approach, even wrote the code. But, while explaining the approach I stumbled. So, do not take the leetcode problems lightly when you're preparing. When solving a question, think of it as it is asked in the real interview
3. **Focus on the problem statement, take data driven decisions**

   I don't know about others,
