### Good days after bad days

When I laid off from my first job, I feared if I can move ahead in life. I still remember that day, after knowing I was fired, I was on my way to hostel. I couldn't sleep for 2 days. I gathered all my courage and started all again. I practiced coding, improved my data structures, algorithms and problem solving skills. Whenever I solved a problem, I used to reward myself by eating good food. After a few days, I cracked a job in [bigbasket](https://bigbasket.com). I felt so happy. I struggled finanically and mentally a lot for my existence.
