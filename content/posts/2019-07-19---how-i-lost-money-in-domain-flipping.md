description: Buying domains at a cheaper price and selling at a higher price
  later is called domain flipping. Out of enthusiasm, I burnt my hands by buying
  domains. In this post, I blog about my experience of domain flipping.

So it all started last year in July when my friend told me about this website called [domainz.io](https://domainz.io). I went through the website, found it interesting, did some research on buying and selling domains. At first, I thought that I can make more money if I buy good domains. so, I headed over to Twitter and asked `domainz` if I can make profits buying domains from him. he said to buy some domains and sell it on flippa, so I bought a subscription for 15$, then browsed through few domains and bought the following domains. Total cost around 20k INR which is a good amount of money.

- cricketlive.tv
- filmed.me
- greb.me
- neither.me
- photogrid.xyz
- tiniurl.co
- wittycode.io
- internetspeedtests.org
- salesforces.co
- wimbledon.me
- kissing.tv
- rockstargames.io
- callrecord.io

I put all my domains in flippa.com with premium listing by paying 59$. I waited for 20 days but still, no one had shown interest. I realized that I fell into a trap and domain flipping is not so easy way to make money. Then, I wanted to sell my domains at least for 50% loss. So, I went to namepros.com and put them on auction. Sold 2 domains for 90% loss ðŸ˜”. Also, I got to know that we shouldn't buy trademarked domains like "rockstargames.io" "wimbledon.me" and "salesforces.co" due to copyright infringements. So, I am afraid and immediately deleted those domains for loss.

Then, I heard about undeveloped.com (now, dan.com) and listed all my domains there. The good thing about them is they provide a neat landing page and statistics about each domain. I waited for a year, but unfortunately, only one domain was sold.

### What did I learn?
- never invest without knowing the basics of anything.
- don't over trust any website/person. in my case, I trusted domainz.io and ended up buying copyrighted domains.
- if you bought a bunch of domains, try developing something on them. But, one pain point is we need to hold the domain until we develop.
