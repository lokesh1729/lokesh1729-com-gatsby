Hey there,

In this blog post, I'll provide the resources required for cracking system design interviews. Over the past year, I have given many interviews. There were a lot of resources present on the internet. But, not all of them work for everyone. Based on my experience, I am sharing these resources which worked well for me.

## Free Resources

[System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) - A bible for system design. A big thanks to [Donne Martin](https://donnemartin.com/) for his contributions. I have gone through this to get my basics refreshed and correct some of the concepts.

[Awesome Scalability](https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability) - An underrated resource. It contains links to all the basics and different use-cases. I read a few articles per week from this list.

[Hiredintech](https://www.hiredintech.com/courses/system-design) - This course has some good basics.

[Low-level design](https://github.com/prasadgujar/low-level-design-primer) - This has a good collection of low-level designs.

[Tianpan](https://tianpan.co/notes/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview) - This blog has short and concise designs. I had gone through this in the end.

There are youtube channels about system design, but I found none of them gone through much into depth. If you like learning from videos, you can refer below.

## Paid Resources

[Grokking System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) - This is a very famous course about system design. I purchased and gone through. But, honestly, I don't find it has much depth. It was all very basic and naive I felt.

[Interviewready](https://get.interviewready.io) - This course is from Gaurav Sen. He is famous on youtube for system design content. I haven't purchased this. But, I heard good reviews from people.

That's all folks!
