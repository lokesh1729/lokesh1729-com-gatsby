Hey,


My name is lokesh. I am from india, born in a village near tuni, andhra pradesh. I graduated from [RGUKT IIIT nuzvid](https://rguktn.ac.in). I was introduced to programming as an academic subject in my college in 2009. I started with python, then C and then Java. When I took computer science as my majors I was so excited to learn about it. I loved data structures and algorithms since it was introduced in the college. After college, I fell in love with software engineering since 2015. I love building products from scratch and scaling them to millions of users.  I love problem solving so much such that it became my way of living life. Be it a software engineering problem, DSA problem or anything related to life, I started looking it as a problem and solving it optimally. This kind of mindset helped me in my life in many ways. You can learn more about my professional journey at my [linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/lokesh1729). Apart from work, I also contribute to open source and do some side projects that makes peoples life easier.
