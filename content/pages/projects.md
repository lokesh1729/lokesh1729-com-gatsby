I have been working on multiple projects apart from my full-time job.

## Job Board

This is an open-source project built using Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, TailwindCSS and Bootstrap. The idea behind this project is to provide a free option for anyone who is looking for setting up a job board. More about the features of this project is present on the README.md file of the repo. [The roadmap of this project is publicly available](https://www.notion.so/lokesh1729/eb2c0f9b30f14ffaa192460818db7fdc?v=ba714156385448c783a1be65afb7d270&pvs=4) and I post the updates on twitter too. My twitter handle is [@lsanapalli](https://twitter.com/lsanapalli)

## Mutual Funds NAV Alert

Unlike stocks you cannot set alerts on the NAV of a mutual fund. No mutual fund broker platform gives this feature. This will be very helpful when you want to sell but the price is not as you desired. I have not started this project yet. Once started, will update here.
