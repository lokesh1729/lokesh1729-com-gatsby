Managing finance is a hard job. If you are working at a company or self-employed, you need to be aware of the inflows and outflows of your money. Because you have done a lot of hard work at the job and earned that money. I will be discussing my personal finance journey.

I started my career in 2015. I used to get a small cheque every month. I kept some money myself and sent some to the home. My uncle had suggested investing in local chit funds in my hometown, so I used to invest in it. I used [Walnut app](https://axio.co.in/walnut/) (now Axio) to track the expenses. It auto-tracks the transactions and gives me nice analytics too. It was not tracking the income at that time, so I used to have a dilemma as to whether to mark investments as expenses or not.
